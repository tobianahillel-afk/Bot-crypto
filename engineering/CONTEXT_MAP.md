## Resume hint

- Handoff: engineering/handoff/CURRENT.json
- Objective: LOT-45.1-WU07: reconcile observed isolated WU08 activation without treating it as certification or permission for WU09.
- Next action: An independent isolated-branch R2 WU08 activation is now at 4dd6e1ef8e14d3d56c886a202a810de6e3d14b89, 2 commits and exactly 7 administrative paths after PR67 integration base. WU02 DONE/WU08 IN_PROGRESS there, but zero exact-head Actions/check runs: NOT CERTIFIED. Engineering Bootstrap dispatch on exact isolated ref plus Security Secrets and R2 validators required. Verify claimed approval independently. WU09 remains separately gated; never edit workflows, PR66, PR67, main, frozen evidence, Lot46 or runtime/trading authority.
