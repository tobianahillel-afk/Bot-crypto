## Resume hint

- Handoff: engineering/handoff/CURRENT.json
- Objective: LOT-45.1-WU07: reconcile isolated PRE-01A preparation-grant observation, preserve R2 authorization boundary.
- Next action: Read business/plans/LOT45_REMEDIATION_PLAN.json execution_branch_binding_design.pre01a_branch_authority_packet.subsequent_external_observation: isolated head 0b3ed78f one commit after PR67 records preparation-only R2 grant. WU02 remains IN_PROGRESS, WU08 manifest absent, no exact-head CI. Require separate approved and qualified R2 scope/state transition before WU08 activation; workflow edits require distinct WU09. Preserve PR66/PR67/main and Lot46 lock.
