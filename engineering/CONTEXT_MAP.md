- Objective: LOT-45.1-WU07: establish exact PRE-01A integration-branch authorization preflight without candidate mutation.
- Next action: Validate PRE-01A branch-local R2 AWU design and integration ancestry, then separately activate a scoped AWU on PR67 before changing the two Lot45 workflows. PR66/main/Lot46 remain unchanged.
